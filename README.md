# Notification Rate Limiter

This is a simple Java application that simulates sending notifications while enforcing rate limits based on notification types and recipient.

## Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Gradle (Build Automation)
- Lombok (for reducing boilerplate code)

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates how to implement rate limiting for notifications using Java. It includes:

- Different types of notifications (STATUS, NEWS, MARKETING).
- Rate limit rules per notification type (e.g., 2 per minute for STATUS notifications).
- Simulated notification sending and rate limit enforcement.
